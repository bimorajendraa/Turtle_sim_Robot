# TurtleSIM
<p>Using ROS and c++ and help from turtlesim to run this. Listener node that will control the turtle's movement using the AWSD keys (A to turn left, D to turn right, W to move up, and S to move down). Additionally, you'll use OpenCV to read images in the new arena and redraw the lines that the turtle has traversed.</p>
